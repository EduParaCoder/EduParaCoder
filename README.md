- 👋 Hi, I’m @EduParaCoder
- 👀 I’m interested in making resources available to better the lives of people who ate differently abled.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... EVERYTHING! 😰 im a complete novice although a long time dreamer. recently I've dabbled with ChatGPT and it has been such a useful tool with my afflictions especially Autism: no not the super hero EXTRAordinary kind. just the get in the way of life kind.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Generative image AI's has been a focus lately. but eventually after educating myself more and understanding it better I'd like to see how we can apply this to differently abled people to increase the capacity of their lifelyhood.
- 📫 How to reach me I guess here? the Woooorld Wiiiiiode Weeeeeb scares me but of anyone can point me in the right direction im a hyperfocused dedicator Educator.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him but I prefer the term "Bro"nouns 😜
- ⚡ Fun fact: On average, a photon takes about a million years, from its birth, to make its eay out of the chaos that is our star the sun, to reach us here on earth. Although it doesnt take nearly that long, once exiting said sun, to to traverse the distance to earth. Makes me feel connected to things well before, and after my time.
